This is a JAVA SWING desktop application. All of the files are sealed
withinin the accompanying gulfmap.jar file. This may be activated by
double-clicking on the jar file or by typing the command 'java -jar
deskmap.jar' in the command prompt window on LINUX or WINDOWS 10
computers.

The accompanying resource directory contains JSON anf KML folders for
storing maps that are produced by the application. The beginr.txt file
contains an introduction to the application which can be seen in the
opening menu when the application is started. It may not be moved or
deleted, otherwise the application will not work.

The overall purpose of the application is to record the name of pastoral
infrastructure sites where this information is no longer extant and has
been destroyed or forgotten. It also allows the query and mapping of
currently known pastoral infrastructure sites in North Queensland. The
background.md document in this repsoitory contains the same text.

There is a web-based version of this application at
https://stockroute.org/Cattle/.

If you do not hava a current version of JAVA on your computer then
download the my-runtime18.zip file, which is also in this repository.
The following command will then start the application

PATH/java-runtime18/bin/java -jar guestmap.jar

Please note that this command must be executed from within the same
folder as the deskmap.jar file. PATH is the full name of the path to the
folder containing your customised java runtime.
